## I. Introduction

### Background

*Provide a brief background on the topics of regional development and inequality.*

### Objectives

*Outline the main objectives and research questions addressed in Assignments 1, 2, and 3.*

Throughout the semester in our econometrics course, we completed three distinct assignments, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of regional development and inequality within the Czech Republic, Turkey, Finland and the United Kingdom.

The primary objective of the first assignment was to acquire, process, and analyze sub-national GDP and population data.
This involved calculating GDP per capita and the population-weighted GDP Gini coefficient, followed by an exploration of regional inequality through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

The second assignment focused on examining the relationship between regional development and inequality specifically for the year 2010, utilizing cross-sectional estimation techniques.
We used simple linear regression to explore the initial relationship and then enhanced our analysis by incorporating potential determinants of regional inequality through a multiple linear regression.

In the third assignment, we delved into exploring alternative function forms, namely logarithmic and quadratic, and implemented panel estimates to analyze the relationship between regional development and inequality.

This academic paper aims to synthesize and consolidate the critical findings derived from Assignment 1, 2 and 3, providing a cohesive understanding of regional development and inequality within the specified countries.
