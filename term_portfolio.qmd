## I. Introduction

### Background

Regional development plays a crucial role in driving economic growth, representing a collective effort to enhance well-being and living standards in regions, and improve their contribution to national performance, fostering more inclusive and resilient societies [@oecd].
As regions navigate the intricate dynamics of growth, decline, and adaptation, diverse economic, social, and environmental outcomes emerge [@pike2016].
These variations give rise to the concept of regional inequality - a phenomenon rooted in the uneven distribution of resources, opportunities, and development across different regions.
Regional inequality is a fundamental challenge for human society, a central focus of academic research, and a major concern of governments [@wei2015].
There has been a long-lasting debate about the scope, dimensions, trajectory, mechanisms, and consequences of regional inequality, along with the policies that address disparity [@wei2015].
Regional inequality is a hotly debated topic and we should care about it because it is essential for both the economy and social welfare in general.
The potential consequences of regional inequality are many.
@lessmann2017 highlights a correlation between regional inequality and personal income inequality, ethnic inequality, and political stability.
Addressing regional imbalances within countries is crucial, as they may independently contribute to economic outcomes and exacerbate issues like income inequality, ethnic tensions, and segregation.

This paper delves into the intricate dynamics of regional development and inequality within a subset of European countries.
The selected subset comprises the Czech Republic, Turkey, Finland and the United Kingdom.
Analysing these countries provides a nuanced understanding of regional development and inequality, offering insights into potential policy interventions aimed at fostering more balanced and inclusive development pathways.

### Objectives

Throughout the semester in our econometrics course, we completed three distinct assignments, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of regional development and inequality within the Czech Republic, Turkey, Finland and the United Kingdom.

The primary objective of the first assignment was to acquire, process, and analyse sub-national GDP and population data.
This involved calculating GDP per capita and the population-weighted GDP Gini coefficient, followed by an exploration of regional inequality through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Moving on to our second assignment, our objective shifted towards examining the relationship between regional development and inequality for the year 2010, utilizing cross-sectional estimation techniques.
We employed simple linear regression to explore the initial relationship and enriched our analysis by incorporating potential determinants through multiple linear regression.In the third assignment, we delved into exploring alternative function forms, specifically logarithmic and quadratic, and implemented panel estimates to scrutinize the relationship between regional development and inequality.

Synthesizing the critical findings from Assignments 1, 2, and 3, this paper aims to provide a cohesive understanding of regional development and inequality within the specified countries, shedding light on the complexities of this issue.

### Significance

The exploration of regional development and inequality within the context of the Czech Republic, Turkey, Finland and the United Kingdom reveals important insights into the dynamics of economic growth and disparities at regional levels.

In a time characterized by increasing interconnectedness, understanding the intricacies of regional development is imperative.Regional development not only shapes the well-being and living standards of regions but also plays a crucial role in bolstering national performance.

This research delves into the complexities of regional development and inequality in the selected countries, providing valuable insights that can guide policy interventions.
The pressing concern of regional inequality highlights the necessity for a nuanced analysis to inform targeted policies and initiatives.
The uneven distribution of resources, opportunities, and development underscores the importance of addressing these issues, especially as the impacts of regional inequality are more pronounced than ever.

Policies promoting balanced growth and mitigating disparities among regions take on heightened relevance in the current global context.
This research not only expands the understanding of regional dynamics but also equips with the knowledge needed for more balanced and inclusive development pathways, fostering a more equitable global future.

## II. Literature Review

### Previous Work

According to @lessmann2017, when certain regions experience higher levels of economic development and prosperity compared to others, it can have far-reaching consequences.
However, in general are the empirical studies on regional inequality limited to a specific country sample with a general bias towards medium and high income economies.
The challenge is obtaining data from the less developed regions in the world.
The poorest regions appear as blank spots on the map.
@lessmann2017 fill this research gap by predicting regional incomes using satelilite nighttime light data for the countries with no reliable statistical data available.
The higher nighttime light intensity, the higher level of economic activity.The data on the very poorest countries allowed @lessmann2017 to estimate the upward sloping part of the Kuznets curve in regional inequalities.
They found that the relationship between regional development and regional inequality follow a pattern similar to a N-shape.
By examining changes in inequality over time, @lessmann2017 found that the majority of all countries experience sigma convergence, which means that regional inequality decreases over time.
However, they found that some poor and lower-middle-income countries, along with some rich economies, show divergence.
This shows that very poor countries exhibit increasing inequalities, while most middle- and high-income countries show decreasing or stabilizing inequalities.
Interestingly, regional inequalities increase again in the richest countries, forming the right side of the N-shaped pattern [@lessmann2017].
